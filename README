A really trivial example on how to upload an Arduino program using a make file

1. See http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html
2. This example works with the Freetonics TwentyTen board
3. See also https://github.com/freetronics/TwentyTen/issues/1

To discover what settings work with your board set the option
`upload.verbose=true` in the file `~/.arduino/preferences.txt`

You can then review the output to discover the upload options that work from the IDE.

In my case I had to change the baud rate as shown in the makefile. You can review the file
`$(ARDUINO_DIR)/Arduino.mk` to discover what make macros you modify/set

This project also shows a sample `.gitignore`
